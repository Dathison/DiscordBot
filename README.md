This is code for my self-hosted Discord bot running on a Raspberry Pi (When it is connected to the internet).  
I intend to use this for improving my Python skills, as well as getting feedback on new features and improvements on current ones.

Reminder to myself: When posting scripts, don't add the fucking token straight to Git you idiot. At least the token has been changed now, so none of you can snag it.

# How To  
To suggest new features or changes, either create a new issue under the ''Issues'' tab if you have a concrete suggestion, or start a discussion on the ''Discussions'' tab if you have a tentative idea and want input on it before a full-on issue is created.

If you want to suggest something, have a look under ''Issues'' to see if it hasn't already been suggested, and have a look under ''Discussions'' to see whether somebody is talking about it already. You're always free to add comments in both issues and discussions as you see fit.
