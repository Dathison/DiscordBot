# DiscordBot
Repo for my Discord bot

This is code for my self-hosted Discord bot running on a Raspberry Pi (When it is connected to the internet).  
I intend to use this for improving my Python skills, as well as getting feedback on new features and improvements on current ones.

Reminder to myself: When posting scripts, don't add the fucking token straight to Git you idiot. At least the token has been changed now, so none of you can snag it.
